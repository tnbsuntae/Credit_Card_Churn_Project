# Introduction
Customer retention is crucial for credit card companies, as keeping existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a Kaggle dataset to predict customer churn, helping banks identify at-risk customers and offer them better services or promotions to enhance loyalty.

üîç We'll start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and patterns. Next, we'll preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling, including encoding categorical variables, scaled numerical variables, and balancing the classes. ‚öôÔ∏è We'll then select and tune machine learning models to find the most effective one for predicting churn. Finally, we'll evaluate the models and provide insights to help banks reduce customer attrition and improve their services. üìä

# Background
Customer churn is a major concern for credit card companies, as retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High churn rates can impact profitability and growth, making churn prediction a valuable tool for improving customer retention strategies.

The dataset used in this project, sourced from Kaggle, includes features related to credit card usage, and account details. By analyzing this data, we aim to build predictive models to identify at-risk customers and help credit card companies implement targeted interventions, such as personalized offers and enhanced services.

This background section provides an overview of customer churn issues in the credit card industry and the significance of using machine learning techniques to predict and reduce churn.
