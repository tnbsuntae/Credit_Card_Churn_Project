# Introduction
Customer retention is crucial for credit card companies, as keeping existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a Kaggle dataset to predict customer churn, helping banks identify at-risk customers and offer them better services or promotions to enhance loyalty.

🔍 We'll start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and patterns. Next, we'll preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling, including encoding categorical variables, scaled numerical variables, and balancing the classes. ⚙️ We'll then select and tune machine learning models to find the most effective one for predicting churn. Finally, we'll evaluate the models and provide insights to help banks reduce customer attrition and improve their services. 📊
